## 🔧 How It Works

### Architecture

1. **Document Processing** - Uploaded documents are parsed, chunked, and embedded using state-of-the-art NLP models
2. **Vector Search** - Questions are converted to embeddings and matched against your knowledge base using semantic similarity
3. **AI Generation** - Relevant document chunks are passed to GPT-4 to generate accurate, contextual responses
4. **Source Attribution** - Every answer includes references to source documents for verification

### Tech Stack

- **Bot Framework**: Discord.py
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT-4, text-embedding-ada-002
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone
- **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
- **Dashboard**: React with Firebase Hosting
- **Bot Hosting**: Heroku
- **Subscription Management**: Whop
- **Analytics**: Custom analytics pipeline
- **Caching**: Redis

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)
- **Access Control**: Subscription-gated access verified on every request
- **Data Isolation**: Each customer's knowledge base is completely isolated
- **GDPR Compliant**: Data processing agreements available
- **No Training**: Your data is never used to train AI models
- **Audit Logs**: Complete audit trail of all bot interactions
