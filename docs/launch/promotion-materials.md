### Thread 2: Founder Story

**Tweet 1:**
```
I built Discord QA Bot because I was tired of answering the same questions 47 times a day

Here's how a frustrating week managing my 1,200-member Discord became a profitable SaaS 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The breaking point: Tuesday, 2:37am

*ding* "How do I access the course?"

I had answered this exact question 12 times that day. It's in the welcome message. It's in the FAQ doc. It's pinned in every channel.

Nobody reads anything anymore.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
I thought: "What if the docs could answer themselves?"

I knew AI could understand natural language. I knew Discord had a great bot API.

Surely someone built this already?

Searched for 2 hours. Found complicated self-hosted solutions requiring devs. Nothing simple.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Weekend 1: Built MVP

• Discord bot that responds to mentions
• Upload docs to vector database
• RAG pipeline for accurate answers
• Basic dashboard

Tested in my server Monday morning. Magic.

Members loved it. Mods thanked me. I slept that night.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Posted in 3 Discord admin communities:

"Built a bot that learns from your docs and answers questions. Would this help you?"

72 DMs in 24 hours. Everyone wanted it.

That's when I knew this wasn't just solving MY problem.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
5 beta testers. 2 weeks.

Results:
• 80% drop in mod support time
• Sub-3s response times
• 4.6/5 satisfaction rating
• "Where do I get this?" from their members

One tester: "This is what I always imagined Discord could be"
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Monetization was obvious: Whop

Integrated subscription gating, set up tiers, launched listing.

$29-199/mo depending on community size. Way less than hiring support. Way more scalable than doing it manually.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
Today: Launching publicly

What started as scratching my own itch is now:
• Saving community managers 10+ hrs/week
• Making members happier
• Proving docs don't have to be ignored

Building in public from here. Follow along 🚀

### Thread 3: Behind The Scenes

**Tweet 1:**
```
How Discord QA Bot works under the hood 🔧

A thread on the tech stack behind instant, accurate answers (+ what I learned building it) 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The Stack:

• Discord.py - Bot framework
• OpenAI GPT-4 - Natural language understanding
• Pinecone - Vector database for docs
• FastAPI - Backend API
• React - Dashboard
• Heroku - Bot hosting
• Firebase - Dashboard hosting
• Whop - Subscription management
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Challenge 1: Making it FAST

Users expect <5s responses. Here's how:

1. Pre-process docs into chunks on upload
2. Generate embeddings async
3. Cache common queries in Redis
4. Parallel vector search + LLM call
5. Stream responses to Discord

Result: 95% of queries <3s
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Challenge 2: Making it ACCURATE

LLMs hallucinate. Can't happen with support.

Solution: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

1. Search vector DB for relevant docs
2. Only use retrieved content in prompt
3. Explicit instruction: "Only answer from provided context"
4. Return sources with answer

Zero hallucinations in beta.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Challenge 3: Making it AFFORDABLE

OpenAI + Pinecone costs add up at scale.

Optimizations:
• Chunk size tuning (512 tokens optimal)
• Aggressive caching
• Batch embeddings
• Monitor per-query cost
• Tier limits prevent abuse

Cost per query: ~$0.02. Margins work.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Lessons learned:

❌ Don't build custom auth. Use Whop.
❌ Don't optimize prematurely. Ship fast.
✅ Beta test in real communities
✅ Make docs interactive, not static
✅ Performance > Features for v1
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
What's next:

🔜 Slash commands
🔜 Multi-language support
🔜 Custom branding
🔜 API access
🔜 Analytics improvements
🔜 Integration with Notion/Confluence

Building in public. Ideas? Drop them 👇

**Title:** [Tool] Built an AI bot that learns from your docs and answers questions automatically

```
Hey r/Discord!

I built a bot that solves a problem I had managing my 1,200-member server: answering the same questions over and over.

**What it does:**
- Upload your documentation, FAQs, guides to a web dashboard
- AI processes and indexes everything
- Bot answers questions instantly in Discord (<5s response time)
- Includes analytics on common questions

**Tech:**
Discord.py, GPT-4 for understanding, Pinecone for vector search, web dashboard for management

**Why I built it:**
I was spending 2+ hours/day answering "where is X?" when the answer was literally pinned. Built this in frustration, beta tested with 5 communities, now launching publicly.

**Beta results:**
- 70% less repetitive support questions
- Sub-3s average response time
- 95% answer accuracy
- Worked in education, gaming, SaaS, and NFT communities

**Pricing:**
$29-199/mo depending on server size. 50% off for launch.

Available on Whop: [link]
Demo server: [invite]

Not here to spam - genuinely think this solves a real problem. Happy to answer questions!

#### r/communitymanagement

**Title:** Cut my Discord support workload by 70% with an AI bot - sharing what I learned

```
Context: I manage a 1,200-member Discord for my online course. Was spending 10-15 hours/week answering repetitive questions.

Built an AI bot that learns from documentation and answers automatically. Been using it for 6 weeks in beta. Results:

**Metrics:**
- 70% reduction in time spent on support
- 95% of questions answered correctly
- <5 second response times
- Members love it (4.6/5 rating)

**What I learned:**

1. **People don't read pinned messages**
   Even perfect documentation gets ignored. Making it interactive changed everything.

2. **Speed matters more than perfection**
   Fast, 90% accurate answer beats slow, 100% accurate answer.

3. **Analytics reveal patterns**
   Discovered 80% of questions were about 5 topics. Improved those docs specifically.

4. **It doesn't replace humans**
   Complex issues still need human touch. But bot handles the easy 70%.

5. **ROI is immediate**
   Saved 10 hours/week from day one. Even at $29/mo, that's a no-brainer.

**How it works:**
- Upload docs to web dashboard
- Bot indexes everything
- Members ask questions in Discord
- Bot responds with sourced answers

Now launching it publicly for other community managers: [whop-link]

Not trying to sell - genuinely want to share what worked. Happy to answer questions about implementation, results, or community management in general.

Anyone else using AI for community support? What's worked for you?

**The Problem**
Discord has become the primary communication platform for online communities, from educational courses to gaming guilds to Web3 projects.

- **High Accuracy**: 95% answer accuracy rate in beta testing
- **Easy Setup**: Web dashboard for document management, no coding required
- **Analytics**: Track question patterns and identify knowledge gaps
- **Subscription Integration**: Built-in access control via Whop

**Beta Results**
Five diverse communities beta tested the platform over two weeks:
- 70% average reduction in support workload
- <3 second average response time
- 4.6/5 user satisfaction rating
- Zero critical bugs or security issues

"Discord QA Bot cut our mod workload in half in the first week," says Sarah Martinez, manager of a 2,500-member gaming community. "It's been an absolute game-changer for our team."

**Availability & Pricing**
Discord QA Bot launches today on Whop with three pricing tiers:
- Starter: $29/month (small communities)
